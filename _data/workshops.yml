#    intro: |
#      Managing the state is the most important architectural problem of any React application. The purpose of this workshop is to learn some of the most State Management pattern to use in your front-end applications. We will cover some simple techniques to keep your codebase healthy and different styles of programming like Event-Driven or Reactive. During the workshop, we will build our own State management libraries and compare them with mainstream approaches like Redux or MobX.
